# vulnerable-app for A4-XXE

This folder is intended to contain a minimal vulnerable application demonstrating XML External Entities (XXE).
You can add a small sample app here (Node/Express, PHP, etc.) that intentionally contains the vulnerability.

Suggested structure:
- app/ (source code)
- README.md (how to run)
